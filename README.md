 Components, GameObjects, and Scenes are like parts of a theater production. A Component is a costume, prop, or skill that defines what an actor can do â€” a sword lets them fight, a costume shows their role, and stage directions tell them how to move. A GameObject is the actor themselves, who only becomes a character once those elements are added.

The Scene is the stage and play, where all the actors come together in a shared environment. It provides the set, the lighting, and the context that shape how the actors interact. Thinking about Unity in this way helps me see how Components give functionality, GameObjects embody identity, and Scenes bring everything together into a cohesive performance.
